            widening conversion - Rely on implicit conversion
            Convert a value from a data type that could hold less information to a data type that can hold more information

            narrowing conversion - Explicit conversion
            When performing a narrowing conversion, you need to perform a cast

            ToString() method
            Every data type variable has a ToString() method. On most primitives, it performs a widening conversion
            ** Used to notify other developers that a conversion is taking place. Yet can occur implicitly

            Parse() method
            Most of the numeric data types have a Parse() method.
            ** Used to explicitly convert a string into a numeric data type. Not safe operation.

            Convert class
            has many helper methods to convert a value from one type into another.

                Feature	                Parse	                            Convert
            Handles null safely	    Throws ArgumentNullException	Returns default (e.g., 0)
            Handles invalid format	Throws FormatException	        Throws FormatException
            Handles other types     Only strings	                Multiple types
            Performance	            Slightly faster	                Slightly slower
            Best for	            Safe, guaranteed strings	    Defensive, flexible code

            TryParse() method
                Safer convertion of string data into a numeric data type
                - It attempts to parse a string into the given numeric data type.
                - If successful, it stores the converted value in an out parameter
                - It returns a bool to indicate whether the action succeeded or failed.

        String to Array
            ToCharArray()    Copies string characters to array of chars
            String.Split()   Returns an array of substrings using a provided delimiter

        Array to a string
            String.Join()    combine elements of a specified array using separator between each element
            Create a new string passing in an array of char -> string s = new string(valueArray);

        String Formatting

            Composite formatting - uses numbered placeholders within a string.
            String interpolation - A technique that simplifies composite formatting. use the variable name inside of the curly braces

            Formatting currency :C currency format specifier
            Formatting numbers :N numeric format specifier makes numbers more readable.
            Formatting percentages :P format specifier to format percentages and rounds to 2 decimal places

            Formatting purposes (PadLeft(), PadRight())
            Compare two strings or facilitate comparison (Trim(), TrimStart(), TrimEnd(), GetHashcode(), the Length property)
            What's inside of a string, or a part of the string (Contains(), StartsWith(), EndsWith(), Substring())
            Change the content of the string (Replace(), Insert(), Remove())
            Turn a string into an array of strings or characters (Split(), ToCharArray())

        .IndexOf()       method returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified character
        .LastIndexOf()   returns the index position of the last occurrence of a character
                        Both return -1 if not found
        .Substring()     Retrieves a substring from this instance.
        .IndexOfAny()    reports the index of the first occurrence of any character

        Remove()         deletes the specified characters in the string.
        Replace()        swaps all instances of a string with a new string
        Method Overloading

    exeptions - try, catch, finally, throw, 
    `checked` keyword is used to enable overflow checking for arithmetic

Extension Methods
=========================
let you “add” new methods to existing types without modifying their source code or creating a new derived type.

They’re useful when you want to extend built-in types (like string, int, List<T>, etc.) or even your own classes — in a clean, reusable way.

How it works:
    - You define a public static method inside a static class.
    - The first parameter has the this keyword and tells C# the method is for that type.
    - You call it like an instance method.

 Why Must Extension Methods Be static?
    Because you’re not actually modifying the original type — you’re just using a C# compiler trick that makes it look like the method belongs to the object.
        - The method lives outside the type, so it must be static.
        - It can’t be an instance method — because you don’t own the original class (e.g., string, int).
        - Extension methods are syntactic sugar — they give you a clean, natural way to call static helper functions.

Why this in the First Parameter?

The this tells the compiler:
    “I’m extending the int type. When someone writes x.IsEven(), treat x as the first parameter.”
So:
    - this int number → defines what type you're extending (int)
    - The rest of the parameters are normal input

    e.g
        public static class MyExtensions
        {
            public static ReturnType MethodName(this Type typeToExtend, otherParams)
            {
                // logic
            }
        }

Partial Class
===================
Split class definition across multiple files


Extension Method vs Partial Class
Feature	                    Extension Method	                    Partial Class
Purpose	                Add methods to existing types externally	        Split class definition across multiple files
Keyword used	            this (on the first parameter)	    partial (on class/method declaration)
Connection to class	    Defined outside the class	            Defined as part of the same class
Must be static?	        Yes (method & containing class)	        No (can be instance or static)
Use case	                Add methods to types you don’t own	Organize large classes or mix generated code
Works at runtime?	    No — compiler “glues” it together at compile time	    Same — compiler merges into one class

 Do Extension Methods Override Existing Methods?
    ❌ No, they don’t override anything.
    They just appear like instance methods through compiler trickery, but if the actual type already has a method with the same name and signature — that method takes priority.
