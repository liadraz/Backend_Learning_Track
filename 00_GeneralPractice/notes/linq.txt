LINQ
============

query syntax
method syntax
    The compiler translates LINQ statements written with query syntax into the equivalent method call syntax.

    This method declaration also follows a standard idiom where the input and output types are IEnumerable<T>. That practice enables LINQ methods to be chained together to perform more complex queries.
    a second LINQ idiom: terminal methods


LINQ eager or lazy evaluation
===============================
    Deferred (lazy) evaluation — most IEnumerable<T> LINQ methods:
    These are not executed immediately, but only when you iterate over the result.
        Where
        Select
        Skip
        Take
        OrderBy 

    Eager evaluation — happens when you force execution :
        ToList()
        ToArray()
        Count()
        Sum()
        Any(), All()
        First(), Last()
        
    Tip:
        - If you're chaining many filters and want performance, leave it lazy until you need the result.
        - Use eager (ToList()) only if you need a materialized result now.
