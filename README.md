# C# Learning Track â€“ Weekly Practice Projects

This repository documents my personal learning path towards becoming a proficient Backend Developer (Full Stack), using C#, .NET Core, JS, React, and supporting technologies.

The repository contains a collection of small weekly projects, focused on applying specific programming concepts like OOP, data structures, clean code, and design principles. Each project reflects what I learned that week.

## Goals

- Apply theoretical knowledge by building small, functional apps
- Reinforce key principles of object-oriented programming
- Prepare for real-world backend scenarios
- Showcase consistent progress for potential employers

## Work in Progress

This repository is actively updated as I progress through new topics.  
Every folder contains a self-contained project with a `README.md` and runnable code.

Stay tuned for:

- ASP.NET Core Web API projects  
- EF Core with SQL Server  
- Authentication with JWT  
- Frontend integration with React
