# Backend Developer Learning Track â€“ Weekly Practice Projects

This repository documents my personal learning path towards becoming a proficient Backend Developer (Full Stack), using C#, .NET Core, JS/TS, React, and supporting technologies.

The repository contains a collection of small weekly projects, focused on applying specific programming concepts like OOP, data structures, clean code, and design principles. Each project reflects what I learned that week.
